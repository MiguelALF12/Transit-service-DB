# City Traffic Service Database Project

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a database for a city's traffic service, serving as an academic example to demonstrate the journey from data requirements to a functional database system. The process encompassed detailed analysis, normalization, and representation of various relationships at different levels of abstraction.

## Key Features

- **Normalization**: Ensuring efficient organization of data with minimal redundancy.
- **Relationship Modeling**: Detailed abstraction of entity relationships to reflect real-world interactions within the traffic system.
- **SQL Implementation**: The database was defined and implemented using SQL, including a set of predefined queries to interact with the data.

## Objective

The primary goal was to provide a hands-on experience in transforming theoretical data requirements into a practical, operational database, showcasing the critical steps in database design and implementation.

## Technologies Used

- SQL for database definition and query execution.
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams for initial conceptual modeling.

## Contribution

This project serves as a foundational example for understanding database design principles, especially in the context of municipal services like traffic management.
